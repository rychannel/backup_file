Usage

    backup_file
    backup_file filename [filename1 filename2 ... filenameN]

Description

  backup_file provides a simple command-line tool for creating a backup of one
  or many files. If multiple files are given, or wild characters are used all
  files will be backed up. Each time a file is backed up with backup_file it
  creates a unique name for the backup file consisting of the date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  followed by a '.' and a version number if there is more than one for the
  current date.

  When backup_file is run without any files listed, it displays usage/license
  information. 
 
Installation

  Run the install.sh it will copy script into /usr/local/bin/ and set the
  permissions.
    
Configuration

  backup_file does not accept any command line options. Every command line item
  (after the script name) is assumed to be a filename.

  When listing files separate each filename by a space. You can use one or more
  filenames with either a relative or full path to the file. Wild-cards should
  work properly.

  backup_file is minimally configurable, the following variables can be changed
  to fit your preferences.

    $date
      This defines the command and options used to get the date. Do not remove
      it from its back-tick quotes.
